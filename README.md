# project_sem2_exam

 This is a database that pictures a competition between bike riders on different cycling routes. There are eleven routes starting from many cities and can have all sorts of start/end point combinations. Bike riders are not competing all on the same route, but can follow different roads and are compared to the estimated time of the route they have chosen to cycle.
